    title: "About Me",
    description: `As a System Administrator turned Web Developer, I bring a unique perspective to building AI-powered applications. My background in infrastructure and systems has given me a deep understanding of what makes applications robust and scalable, while my passion for modern web development allows me to create intuitive, user-focused solutions. I specialize in developing applications that leverage generative AI, combining Next.js, Firebase, and various AI technologies to build tools that solve real-world problems. My transition from managing systems to crafting AI-enhanced web experiences has taught me that the best applications aren't just about code â€“ they're about creating reliable, secure, and efficient solutions that make a difference. Currently, I'm focused on building projects that demonstrate how AI can enhance traditional web applications, from personalized fitness assistants to modernized e-commerce platforms.`,
